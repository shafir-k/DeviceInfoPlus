## Open Source Commitment
Device Info Plus is and will remain completely **free and open source**. The entire codebase, including all features, is available under the MIT License.

## Trademark Protection
While the code is open source, please note:

1. **Official App Store Presence**: The official version is available on Google Play Store
2. **Attribution Requirements**: Forks and derivatives should provide clear attribution

## App Store Distribution Guidelines
We encourage community participation, but to avoid user confusion:

### ‚úÖ Encouraged:
- Fork the project with a **different name and branding**
- Contribute improvements back to the main project
- Use the code in your own projects
- Distribute modified versions with proper attribution
- Create specialized variants for specific use cases

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Please Avoid:
- Publishing identical apps with the same "Device Info Plus" name
- Using identical logos, icons, or branding elements
- Creating confusion about which is the official version

## Why This Matters
- **User Trust**: Users should know they're downloading the authentic version
- **Community Growth**: This approach encourages meaningful contributions over clones
- **Project Sustainability**: Helps maintain the project's reputation and development
